Curses::Forms Module for Perl
=============================

Author: Arthur Corliss
Date:  October 10, 2002

Description:
------------

High level access to basic Curses forms for use with Curses::Widgets.

NOTE:  This is **NOT** backwards compatible with the pre-1.99 versions.  This
is entirely OO-based, hence any older scripts relying on the old versions will
need to be rewritten.

Requirements:
-------------

--(n)Curses libraries
--Curses module
--Curses::Widgets modules

Instructions:
-------------

All that one needs to do is:

	perl Makefile.pl
	make test
	make install

Documentation for using the module(s) is available if one types the following:

	perldoc Curses::Forms
